# MediQ
This is a mini project for Software Engineering subject of junior students at KMITL. MediQ is a queuing mobile application for Ladkrabang hospital. The objective of this application is for doing queue reservation when users are going to the hospital so they won't waste their time for waiting a long time at the hospital but there are still have some problem with this idea that is a digital divide. Some people don't use any smart device or internet that may cause the disadvantage for them to the queuing.
